# FDA FSVP repository
The purpose of this repository is to keep track of all the FSVP records TrueTech Inc has established for suppliers that are in the Agroverse's transparent direct to consumer distribution network

## How it works
The suppliers folder has sub-folders. Each of them represents the repository of the FSVP records we have established on the supplier we have included in our Agroverse network

The regulations folder contains all the documentation of known USA FDA FSVP regulations that we should comply with regarding the FSVP records
